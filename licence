## Notes on creativity & optimization
- The UI uses a clean card design with a sticky nav and subtle shadows, feeling modern with little code.
- The backend uses blueprints and a small schema layer for explicit boundaries and easier testing.
- CI keeps the repo healthy; TypeScript & pydantic give guardrails without heavy frameworks.

## How to apply this to your repo
1. Create folders `backend/` and `frontend/` in your repo root (if they donâ€™t exist).
2. Copy each file above into place.
3. Push to GitHub on `main` to trigger CI.
4. Run locally as per **Install & Run**.


Happy building! ðŸŽ‰
